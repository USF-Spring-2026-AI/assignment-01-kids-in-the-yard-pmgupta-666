1) What classification scheme does Awad use, and why do these types matter 
for scientific research?
--------------
Awad classifies AI according to functional paradigms within the 
scientific process, rather than by technical architecture alone. 
The main categories (Section 1) include:
    Predictive AI: forecasting and modelling outcomes
    Descriptive AI: pattern discovery and knowledge mapping
    Generative AI: synthesizing new data, hypotheses, or simulations
    Optimization AI: automating and improving experimental design
    Causal & Explainable AI: uncovering cause–effect relationships 
    and ensuring interpretability
    Privacy-aware AI: enabling secure collaboration with sensitive data
    Meta-scientific AI: automating parts of the scientific 
    discovery process itself
This scheme matters because it aligns AI types with distinct stages of the 
scientific method.
In the early stage of observing patterns, descriptive AI helps researchers 
uncover structures, themes, and relationships within large datasets. When 
it comes to modelling and predicting, predictive AI enables forecasting and 
simulation based on learned patterns. For hypothesis generation, generative 
AI can synthesize new ideas, data, or theoretical possibilities. 
In experiment design, optimization AI improves and automates 
decision-making to identify the most effective experimental strategies. 
For explanation and validation, causal and explainable AI methods help 
clarify cause–effect relationships and make complex models interpretable. 
In terms of ethical data use, privacy-aware AI ensures sensitive information 
is protected while still enabling collaboration. Finally, at the most 
advanced level, meta-scientific AI supports or partially automates the 
entire research pipeline, contributing to hypothesis formation, experiment 
planning, and knowledge integration across disciplines.
Awad emphasizes that AI is not monolithic, but a constellation of paradigms 
that reshape how knowledge is produced. This functional classification 
highlights how AI moves beyond data processing into shaping scientific 
reasoning itself.

2) Does Awad make a clear distinction between AI as a tool and AI as a s
cientific collaborator? If so, what are the differences and what are some 
examples given to support the differences? Do these examples suggest 
a real shift in how science is conducted, or mostly an extension of existing 
methods? 
-----------
Awad does draw a meaningful distinction between AI as a computational tool 
and AI as a scientific collaborator. As a tool, AI assists with defined 
tasks (analyzing medical images, predicting protein structures, or 
modelling climate systems) within human-framed research questions. 
As a collaborator, however, AI systems (especially meta-scientific 
and agentic models) begin to generate hypotheses, design experiments, 
and connect knowledge across domains with partial autonomy. 
Examples like AI co-scientists or autonomous lab systems suggest that AI 
is not only executing instructions but influencing the direction of inquiry. 
These examples feel less like an extension of traditional methods and more 
like an early shift toward a hybrid human-machine research model.

3) What are some limitations or risks of using AI in science? How do these 
relate to issues such as interpretability, bias, reproducibility, 
or theory formation? 
----------------------
Awad highlights that AI’s power also introduces significant risks. Many 
advanced models operate as “black boxes,” making interpretability and 
scientific validation difficult. Bias embedded in training data can subtly 
shape research outcomes, particularly in socially sensitive fields. 
Reproducibility becomes fragile when models are proprietary or continuously 
updated. Perhaps most importantly, AI’s emphasis on statistical pattern 
recognition may prioritize correlation over causal explanation. If science 
increasingly relies on machine-generated hypotheses without clear theoretical 
grounding, the balance between data-driven insight and conceptual understanding 
could shift in ways that challenge traditional norms of explanation and 
accountability.

4) According to Awad’s arguments, is AI more likely to accelerate scientific 
discovery or to reshape the scientific method itself? Do you agree or disagree?
-------------
Awad suggests that AI is not merely accelerating science but potentially 
reshaping the scientific method itself. In the short term, AI clearly speeds up 
discovery like processing more data, testing more variables, and automating 
experimentation. However, as AI begins to generate hypotheses, reason 
abductively, and design experiments, it starts to influence the epistemic 
foundations of science. I agree that while acceleration is the most visible 
effect today, the deeper long-term impact will likely be structural. AI may 
not replace human reasoning, but it is changing how evidence is generated, 
how explanations are formed, and how scientific authority is distributed 
between humans and machines.
